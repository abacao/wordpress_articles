# Duo Security 2FA Backup

Duo is a great service and had a great app (I wish more services allowed the push functionality) but it has a catch - it doesn't allow any kind of backup &/or cloud synchronization between several devices.

### Here is the place where all is:

```
root@kenzo:/data/data/com.duosecurity.duomobile/files/duokit/accounts.json
```

As you may have noticed, it requires root but that **accounts.json** has all the information that is required to be stored.

Njoy
